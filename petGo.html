                <h4>1/Research</h4>
                <h5>Interview</h5>
                <p>We interviewed with 8 pet owners to find out what kind of pet owners will think taking pets out is a
                    problem and why they think it is a problem .We went to the pet shop and garden to interview the
                    participants. One person interview, another person record.</p>
                <img src="./images/interview.png" alt="">
                <h6>Partial respondents</h6>
                <ul class="respondents">
                    <li class="respondent1">“My cat never go out far away. Usually I use a cat bag to carry it away at a
                        close distance.When it need to take a shower, I will help it. And when my cat sees a doctor, the
                        doctor will come to my home.”</li>
                    <li class="respondent2">“I walk the dog every day and I take my dog out with shared car.But the
                        procedure for parking and renting a shared car is inconvenient.”</li>
                    <li class="respondent3">“My cat rarely goes outside.I only take the cat out to see a doctor.Because
                        there is no good hospital nearby.So I feel that it is very troublesome to go out with a cat to
                        see a doctor even if I use DiDi. ”</li>
                    <li class="respondent4">“When I need to take my dog to see a doctor,
                        I will choose a good pet hospital even if it is far away.I usually take my dog out with my car.
                        I don’t think it is inconvinient.”</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Key points</h6>
                <p>- Taking a pet out is mainly to the pet hospital for seeing a vet or bathing the pet.
                    <br />
                    - They will choose the reputable hospital even if it is far away.<br />
                    - The owners who don’t have a car will choose to take pets out by DiDi or rent a shared car, but
                    they
                    still feel inconvenient.<br />
                    - Most pet owners who have a car will choose to drive with a pet and will not feel inconvenient.
                </p>
                <h5>Analysis of existing pet travel plans</h5>

                </div>
                <h5>Design insights</h5>
                <p>After interviews and analysis, we found that people who are generally inconvenient to take pets out
                    are basically young pet owners who do not have a car. The reason is that there is currently no pet
                    travel service in the Chinese market that satisfies the needs of pet owners. The pet owner's needs
                    are safe, convenient, and pleasant to transport the pet to the destination.</p>
                <p>- Once there is a convenient pet travel service, the pet owner will be happy to use it.<br />
                    - After the pet owner meets the goal of taking the pet convenient and fast, they will pursue a
                    comfortable pet travel environment<br />
                    - The pet travel service cooperating with the pet hospital will be more in line with the needs of
                    the pet owners.</p>

            <h5>Persona</h5>
            <p>We found that pet owners with different personalities have different goals for pet travel service, so we
                target 2 types of users based on previous research.
